            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            Scenarios: Scenarios are questions asked by a site visitor who represents the organization's target audience. 
            The questions will help you drive the content of the website as it provides answers to the questions. Again, 
            much of the content specifications will actually be provided but start thinking about the target audience of 
            the site. Include at least two scenarios.
                Example: for the Bay Area eBiking Club
                • What is the best e-bike to get for mountainous areas?
                • Where can I find contact information for the club's directors?

            show where each color selected will be used, such as headings, paragraphs, background colors, accents, and so on.
                ! Use your selected color schema on this document.

            <h2>Wireframe</h2>
            Wireframe: Design a wireframe of your project's home page layout. Wireframe diagrams can be simple and do not need to have actual content, just representations of content and their layout relationship. Provide a sketch of the home page for the mobile view and for a larger view (wide desktop).

                Remember that earlier in the course you worked with a given wireframe. Country/Place Page
