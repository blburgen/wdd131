            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p>Website Name: Burgener Art</p>
            <p>Domain Name: BurgenerArt.com</p>

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            Site Purpose: The site purpose describes your site's scope as well as the services and information that will be provided.
                Example: for the Bay Area eBiking Club
                • The site provides a hub for regional e-biking by providing trail and e-bike recommendation information along with a 
                membership information form.

            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            Scenarios: Scenarios are questions asked by a site visitor who represents the organization's target audience. 
            The questions will help you drive the content of the website as it provides answers to the questions. Again, 
            much of the content specifications will actually be provided but start thinking about the target audience of 
            the site. Include at least two scenarios.
                Example: for the Bay Area eBiking Club
                • What is the best e-bike to get for mountainous areas?
                • Where can I find contact information for the club's directors?

            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            Color Schema: The color schema refers to the carefully selected site colors. Define at least two colors and 
            show where each color selected will be used, such as headings, paragraphs, background colors, accents, and so on.
                ! Use your selected color schema on this document.

            <h2>Typography</h2>
            Typography: The typography section of the planning document provides examples of the fonts to be used and where 
            they are to be applied. You should select no less than one font and no more than three fonts. Indicate where each 
            font will be used (such as headings, body, and so on). Other fonts can be used for special circumstances or sections 
            as needed.

            <h2>Wireframe</h2>
            Wireframe: Design a wireframe of your project's home page layout. Wireframe diagrams can be simple and do not need to have actual content, just representations of content and their layout relationship. Provide a sketch of the home page for the mobile view and for a larger view (wide desktop).

                Remember that earlier in the course you worked with a given wireframe. Country/Place Page
